A curated list of awesome things related to the concept of Neumorphism

# What's Neumorphism ?

## How it all start ?

### Flat UIs
Once upon a time, the design world was flat. It was 2-d. There were no shadows or gradients. Everything was either growing in x or y direction. At this stage, designs were used to be called Flat UIs.

### Skeumorphism
Then, a new age came. Designs became 3-d. Shadows and gradients got used excessively. Design components became more better, more close to real-world counterparts. UIs got more advanced. We came to know this period as Skeumorphic period.

But then.....
Neumorphism came. It got her name from 'New Skeumorphism'. Neumorphism got popular.

The main difference between Neumorphism and Skeumorphism is that Skeumorphism only focused on using shadows or gradients. However, Neumorphism focuses on using shadows to create design components which are raised from root layer or vice versa. This gives designs a transition from life-less representations to something more real and close to the world in which we live. And that's the motivation for this library.
